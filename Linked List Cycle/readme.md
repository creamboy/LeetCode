Linked List Cycle 

Given a linked list, determine if it has a cycle in it.

Follow up:
Can you solve it without using extra space?

The main idea of this problem is using fast and slow runner(pointer).
We should think carefully about the while condition in the code to avoid NullPointerException.

Time complexity: O(n)
Space: O(0)
