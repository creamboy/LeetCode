Single Number  

Given an array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:
Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Java:
Python:
Use XOR

Runtime:
Java O(n) Python O(n)

Space:
Java O(0) Python O(0)
